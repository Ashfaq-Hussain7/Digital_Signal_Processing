Digital Signal Processing Projects:

Welcome to my repository for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) projects! This repository contains various implementations and experiments related to DSP, including Fourier Transforms, signal filtering, and other important concepts.
The projects include:

1. Fourier Transform And Parsevel's Theorem
This project explores the Fourier Transform, a fundamental concept in DSP that transforms a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain.
Parseval's Theorem is a key result in Fourier analysis that relates the total energy of a signal in the time domain to the total energy in the frequency domain. This project provides a Python implementation and example.

2. Signal Sharpening
This project focuses on techniques in digital signal processing (DSP) that enhances the edges or details in a signal using two types of Laplacian filters. 
   
3. Signal Smoothing and Noise Removal
This project focuses on techniques for removing noise from signals, using methods like the Average and Gaussian filter. The goal is to demonstrate how to clean and smooth signals for better analysis.
