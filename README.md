Welcome to my repository for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) projects! This repository contains various implementations and experiments related to DSP, including Fourier Transforms, signal filtering, and other important concepts.
Projects
1. Fourier Transform
This project explores the Fourier Transform, a fundamental concept in DSP that transforms a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain.

2. Signal Smoothing and Noise Removal
This project focuses on techniques for removing noise from signals, using methods like the Savitzky-Golay filter. The goal is to demonstrate how to clean and smooth signals for better analysis.

3. Parseval's Theorem
Parseval's Theorem is a key result in Fourier analysis that relates the total energy of a signal in the time domain to the total energy in the frequency domain. This project provides a Python implementation and example.
